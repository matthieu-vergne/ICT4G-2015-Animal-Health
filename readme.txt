This project is one of the challenges of the ICT4G hackathon "Hacking for Southern Africa":
http://www.ict4g.org/hackathon/

The challenge we deal with, here, is about helping donkey carters managing their donkeys. The adopted solution aims at providing to everyone quick and relevant information when they encounter a donkey: by checking a QR code attached to the donkey, anyone having a mobile with Internet can obtain the name of the donkey, contact information of its owner, and additional information to pay attention to, like avoiding sick donkeys or be careful with pregnant ones. This way, people know how to deal with the donkey and immediately contact the owner for him to come and take it back.

The current project is a prototype website providing different features for the purpose described above. It is hard coded, so no database is involved and no data can be changed, but it can be run on any computer having an Apache web server. QR codes and other resources are taken directly from the web, so you might have missing stuff if you are not connected. The prototype website runs online (http://matthieu-vergne.fr/donkey/) and if you check the informations of a donkey, and scan its QR code with your mobile phone, you can display the mobile notification.
